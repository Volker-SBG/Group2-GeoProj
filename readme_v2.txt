Meeting with Hannah
    Propsal 1: Rename Pictures from Flight
        - Rename Pictures from sequence number to combination of row and column naming
        - Resample pictures to smaler resoultion to save space
        - Create visual preview
        - Transform or reproject to different coordinate system
    Proposal 2: Workflow for processing Drone data

Volker: Description of proposed funktions -
    a) Renaming of sequentially named pictures from foto flight (Drone, Plane) -
          - The most northern row starts with 01
          - numbering of pictures (stripes) from west to east, most western foto starts with 0001
          - fotos with comparing east value have identical (column) number
          - variations in numbering due to topography is acceptable (due to maintaining the ground resolution and the required longitudinal and transverse overlap).
    b) Downsampling or any other analysis of the aerial fotos
    c) Create TFW file from aerial fotos
    d) Transform or reproject to different coordinate system

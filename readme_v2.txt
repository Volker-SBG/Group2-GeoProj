Volker: Proposal for a function
Pictures taken during a flight are named in sequence.
Goal is to rename the pictures odered in rows and collumns

Kelechi: suggested Deadline: 1st. Week of August (would be around August, 6th)

Volker: Description of proposed funktions -
    a) Renaming of sequentially named pictures from foto flight (Drone, Plane) -
          - The most northern row starts with 01
          - numbering of pictures (stripes) from west to east, most western foto starts with 0001
          - fotos with comparing east value have identical (column) number
          - variations in numbering due to topography is acceptable (due to maintaining the ground resolution and the required longitudinal and transverse overlap).
    b) Downsampling or any other analysis of the aerial fotos
    c) Create TFW file from aerial fotos
